# Morphik Integration Plan

This document outlines the technical steps for integrating Morphik into the existing project.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Familiarization

*   **Step 1.1: Install Morphik CLI**
    *   Ensure Morphik CLI is installed and accessible in the development environment.
    *   Verify Morphik CLI version compatibility with the project's requirements.
*   **Step 1.2: Project Initialization**
    *   Initialize Morphik within the project repository using `morphik init`.
    *   Review and understand the generated Morphik configuration files.
*   **Step 1.3: Familiarize with Morphik Concepts**
    *   Study Morphik documentation, focusing on core concepts like schemas, migrations, and data sources.
    *   Explore Morphik example projects or tutorials to gain practical experience.

## Phase 2: Schema Definition and Initial Migration

*   **Step 2.1: Define Data Schemas**
    *   Identify all data models and their relationships within the existing project.
    *   Translate these models into Morphik schema definitions (`.morphik.hcl` files).
    *   Pay close attention to data types, constraints, and relationships to ensure accurate representation.
*   **Step 2.2: Generate Initial Migration**
    *   Use `morphik generate migration --name initial_migration` to create the first migration file.
    *   Review the generated migration script to ensure it accurately reflects the defined schemas.
*   **Step 2.3: Apply Initial Migration**
    *   Execute `morphik migrate up` to apply the initial migration to a development or staging database.
    *   Verify that the database schema matches the Morphik schema definitions.

## Phase 3: Data Migration (if applicable)

*   **Step 3.1: Assess Data Migration Needs**
    *   Determine if existing data needs to be migrated to the new Morphik-managed schema.
    *   Identify any data transformations or mappings required during migration.
*   **Step 3.2: Develop Data Migration Scripts**
    *   Create custom scripts or use Morphik's data migration features (if available) to transfer data.
    *   Thoroughly test data migration scripts in a non-production environment.
*   **Step 3.3: Execute Data Migration**
    *   Perform the data migration process, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
    *   Validate migrated data against source data to confirm accuracy.

## Phase 4: Integration with Application Code

*   **Step 4.1: Update Data Access Layers**
    *   Modify application code to interact with the Morphik-managed database.
    *   Replace direct database queries with Morphik-generated query builders or ORM integrations (if applicable).
*   **Step 4.2: Test Application Functionality**
    *   Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure all application features work correctly with the new database schema.
    *   Address any compatibility issues or errors that arise during testing.

## Phase 5: Ongoing Schema Management

*   **Step 5.1: Iterative Schema Changes**
    *   For future schema modifications, follow the Morphik workflow:
        1.  Update Morphik schema definitions.
        2.  Generate a new migration using `morphik generate migration --name <migration_name>`.
        3.  Apply the migration using `morphik migrate up`.
*   **Step 5.2: Version Control and Collaboration**
    *   Commit Morphik schema files and migration scripts to version control.
    *   Establish clear guidelines for collaboration on schema changes among team members.

## Phase 6: Deployment and Monitoring

*   **Step 6.1: Deploy to Production**
    *   Plan and execute the deployment of Morphik-managed schema changes to the production environment.
    *   Consider strategies for minimizing downtime during deployment.
*   **Step 6.2: Monitor Database Performance**
    *   Monitor database performance and query efficiency after Morphik integration.
    *   Optimize Morphik schemas and queries as needed to maintain optimal performance.

This plan serves as a general guideline. Specific steps and considerations may vary depending on the project's unique requirements and complexity.

## Phase 6: Testing & Validation

### Further Testing (Manual)

The automated setup includes placeholder unit tests for the new Morphik components. However, comprehensive testing requires manual steps:

1.  **Implement Full Unit Tests:** Flesh out the placeholder unit tests in `tests/components/` with comprehensive checks, including mocking dependencies as needed.
2.  **Integration Tests:** Modify `tests/test_api.py` (or equivalent) to send requests to the `/api/chat` endpoint and verify that it returns valid responses processed by the Morphik pipeline. This will test the end-to-end flow within the application.
3.  **Manual Validation:** Use the interactive API documentation (e.g., `/docs` for FastAPI) to manually send various queries to the chat endpoint. Confirm that the responses are as expected and that the Morphik pipeline is functioning correctly.
4.  **LangSmith Evaluation:** Monitor your LangSmith dashboard (or other evaluation system) to ensure that evaluation metrics are still being captured correctly and that the quality of responses from the new Morphik-based pipeline meets your standards. This is critical for maintaining response quality.
5.  **BM25 Encoder:** The `scripts/fit_and_save_encoder.py` script needs to be run with actual training data and the correct `create_bm25_encoder` function to produce a functional `fitted_bm25.pkl`.
6.  **Data Ingestion:** The `scripts/ingest_data.py` script needs to be tested with actual documents and a configured Pinecone (or other vector store) environment.
7.  **Dependencies**: Ensure `morphik-ai` and `google-generativeai` are correctly installed in the final environment. The `requirements-morphik.txt` may need to be manually verified or regenerated if `pip-compile` failed.
